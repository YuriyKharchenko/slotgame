The first game (“slotgame”) should have the following rules:

•	The player has an infinite amount of coins.
•	The player bets 10 coins to play a normal game round
•	In any round (free or normal), the player has a 30 % chance of winning back 20 coins.
•	In any round (free or normal), the player also has a 10% chance of triggering a free round where the player does not have to pay for bet. The free round works in the same way as a normal round except it costs 0 coins. The free round should follow immediately after the normal round.
•	The player can both win coins and free round at the same time.
